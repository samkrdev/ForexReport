# Alternative Release APK Generation

## Method 1: Extract APK from AAB (Using bundletool)

1. **Download bundletool:**

   ```bash
   # Download from: https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases
   # Place bundletool-all-1.15.4.jar in your project folder
   ```

2. **Generate APK from your working AAB:**

   ```bash
   java -jar bundletool-all-1.15.4.jar build-apks --bundle=build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --output=VakhariaForex.apks --mode=universal
   ```

3. **Extract the universal APK:**

   ```bash
   # Rename .apks to .zip and extract
   # You'll find universal.apk inside
   ```

## Method 2: Temporary Fix for Direct APK Build

1. **Temporarily remove printing functionality:**
   - Comment out PDF export features
   - Remove printing plugin from pubspec.yaml
   - Build release APK
   - Add printing back for web/debug builds

2. **Use different PDF plugin:**
   - Replace `printing` with `pdf` package
   - Modify download_utils_mobile.dart accordingly

## Method 3: Use Debug APK with Release Performance

```bash
flutter build apk --debug --dart-define=flutter.inspector.structuredErrors=false
```

This gives you an APK with better performance than standard debug builds.

## Current Working Files

- Debug APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk` ✅
- Release AAB: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` ✅

## Recommendation

Use the App Bundle for Google Play Store distribution. For direct APK distribution, use Method 1 above to extract a universal APK from your working AAB.
